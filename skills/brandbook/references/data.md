# brand.json, field by field

Read when you fill or change `brand.json`. Start from `assets/brand.example.json`, a fictional coffee roastery that uses every field except the photographs (a fictional brand has none; the image fields are below). JSON has no comments, so the rules for each field are here. Paths in the file are relative to the folder that holds `brand.json`.

## 1. meta and sections

- `meta.name`: the exact spelling. `name_confirmed`: true only after the user confirmed it.
- `meta.language`: `pl` or `en`, the language of the book's own labels ("Czytam jako", "Pobierz"). The content is in whatever language you write it.
- `meta.version`, `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `owner` (who answers questions about the book), `contact`, `status` (`draft` or `approved`), optional `made_by`.
- `meta.cover_colour` (optional): the colour id for the dark feature tiles, the "Rules" divider and the closing slide; by default the accent when text on it reads, otherwise the text colour.
- `meta.radius` (optional): the tile corner radius in px on a 1920 × 1080 slide; 20 by default, 0 for a hard-edged brand.
- `meta.label_approver`: the person who approves labels before print (the regulatory role); `"(do wskazania)"` until someone is named. The book prints it under every label.
- `sections`: one headline per section, written as the rule the reader should remember. Keys: `strategy`, `voice`, `applications`, `logo`, `colour`, `type`, `imagery`, `labels`, `print`, `files`, `decisions`. A missing key falls back to the topic name, and `check_brand.py` warns.

## 2. strategy and voice

- `strategy.tagline`: the brand's line, short (best under 35 characters); it is the cover and the closing slide. Without it the cover shows the name.
- `strategy.purpose`: one or two sentences, why the brand exists; the intro slide leads with it.
- `strategy.story` (optional): two or three sentences under the purpose. `strategy.fact` (optional): `{value, label}`, one big true number or fact from the brief ("od 2019", "4 sezony").
- `audience`, `instead_of` (what the customer would use otherwise), `proof` (facts from the brief only), `values` (`value` + `behaviour`: what people do, not an adjective), `decision_rules` (2–3 for cases the book doesn't cover), `signature` (the one element that belongs only to this brand), `rejected` (default looks you rejected and what instead).
- `voice.traits`: pairs `is` / `is_not` ("plainly", "not dryly"). `tone`: per channel, `how` and a real `example`. `words_use`, `words_avoid`, `before_after`, `name_rule`.
- `voice.claims`: health or nutrition claims the brand may use, each with `register_ref` (the EU register entry). Without one, `check_brand.py` errors. Leave it empty rather than invent.

## 3. logo

- `variants[]`: `id`, `name`, `file` (SVG from the client, never redrawn), `use`, `min_px` (screen), `min_mm` (print), `on` (colour ids of backgrounds it may sit on). The first variant is the primary. A variant whose id contains `neg`, `white`, `light` or `inverse` is used on dark backgrounds when `on` doesn't decide.
- `clear_space`: `defined_as` (a part of the mark: "the height of the letter O") and `ratio` (its share of the logo height, used to draw the diagram). Never mm or px.
- `dont[]`: `rule` (a short imperative) and optional `demo`: `stretch`, `squeeze`, `rotate`, `shadow`, `recolor` or `busy`, drawn on the primary logo.
- `finish` (optional): `type` (`foil`, `emboss`, `none`), `min_line_mm`, `min_mm`.

## 4. colours and pairs

- `colours[]`: `id` (lowercase, used everywhere else), `name` (the brand's own name for it), `role` (`background`, `text`, `secondary-text`, `accent`, `line`, `support`), `hex`, `share` (percent of use), `cmyk` (`value` [c, m, y, k], `profile`, `status`, `source`, `date` when proofed), `pantone` (`c`, `u`, `status`).
- The book takes its own look from the roles: the first `background`, `text`, `secondary-text`, `line` and `accent`. So do `tokens.css` and the label text colour.
- `pairs[]`: text and background ids with their `use`. Name at least body text on the background. The book draws a contrast matrix of all text and background colours and outlines the declared pairs.

## 5. type

- `families[]` (one or two): `family` (the CSS name), `role` (`display`, `text`, `numerals`), `fallback` (the CSS stack after it, e.g. `Georgia, serif` for a serif; default `system-ui, sans-serif`), `files` (paths, or objects `{file, weight, style}` for static weights; a plain path is treated as a variable font 100–900), `weights`, `licence`, `licence_file`, `source`, `why` (one sentence, this brand), `office_substitute` (a font available in Word, Google Docs and Canva), `reflex_reason` (only when the family is on the reflex list).
- `scale[]`: `level`, `role`, `px`, `pt`, `line`, `use`.
- `sample`: a sentence with the language's accented letters, shown in every face.

## 6. imagery and applications

- `imagery`: `light`, `composition`, `casting`, `props`, `styling`, `grading` (all six, each a rule a photographer can follow), `do[]`, `dont[]`, `ai` (`allowed`, `banned`, `label`, `approver`).
- `imagery.images[]`: `file`, `alt`, `generated` (the slide footer then says `imagery.ai.label`), `caption` (optional text on the photo), `pos` (CSS object-position), `slot`: `cover` (the cover photo, landscape), `intro` (the intro slide, portrait), anything else goes into the photo mosaic. `imagery.hero_on`: the colour id closest to the part of the cover photo under the logo (top left), so the book picks the variant that reads there: a light id for a bright window or sky, a dark one for shadow. Look at the cover after the build; the book can't measure a photo opened from disk.
- `imagery.worlds[]` (optional, the strongest slides when the brand has variants): `name`, `colour` (id), `image` (a scene in that colour, landscape), `detail` (a portrait or close-up), `line`, `generated`. One overview slide and one slide per world, up to four.
- `applications[]`: `id`, `kind` (`post`, `card`, `email`, `web`, `billboard`), `title`, `headline`, `text`, optional `background` (a colour id; a post defaults to the text colour, the rest to the background) and `image` (covers the mockup). A `billboard` needs an `image` and gets a full slide with the headline and the logo: `headline_at` (`top` or `bottom`, where the photo is calm; at the top the logo sits under the headline, at the bottom it takes the top right corner), `text_colour` (a colour id or HEX; white by default) and `logo_on` (the colour id the logo variant should suit). The book draws each one at its real size from the tokens and places the logo at no less than its minimum, so a mockup can't break the book's own rule.

## 7. labels

- `id` (lowercase letters, digits, hyphens: it becomes the file name), `product`, `category` (`food`, `supplement`, `cosmetic`, `other`), `colour` (a colour id for the label field), `status` (`template`), optional `image` (a product photo for the product-line slide; without it the slide shows the label template on its colour).
- `format`: `name`, `w_mm`, `h_mm` (trim size), `bleed_mm`, `safe_mm`, `largest_surface_cm2` (decides 1.2 or 0.9 mm x-height), and for a wrap-around label `overlap_mm` and `overlap_side` (`left` or `right`: the end the other one covers). Zones may span the full width; the template keeps content out of the overlap and hatches it in the guides.
- `zones[]`: `id`, `role` (`front`, `info`, `legal`), `x_mm`, `w_mm`, laid left to right across the width (a wrap-around label: legal, front, info). One `front` zone carries everything when there is nothing else; then the net quantity sits under the name.
- `front`: `name`, `variant`, `benefit`, `net`. `info[]`: `label` + `text` (usage, origin, roast date). `legal[]`: `key` + `label` + `text`; the keys per category are in `references/labels-eu.md`.
- `nutrition_exempt_reason` when a food is exempt from the nutrition declaration (with the legal basis, to confirm).
- `barcode`: `ean` (13 digits from the client, or null) and `note`. The template draws a box with the size, never bars.
- `legal_pt`, optional `name_pt`, `variant_pt`, `net_pt`: type sizes in points. `render.mjs check` measures the real x-height of the mandatory text and the height of the net quantity's figures, and tells you the size to set.

## 8. print, files, decisions, references, changelog

- `print`: `printer` (null until chosen), `technology`, `pdf`, `profile`, `bleed_mm`, `safe_mm`, `small_text`, `finishes[]` (`type`, `colour`, `layer`), `proof`.
- `files[]`: `path` (a file or a folder), `what`, `print_ready` (true only for files a printer can use as they are; leave it out for files where the question doesn't apply). Built and rendered files (`book/`, `labels/`, `out/`, `tokens.css`) only warn until they exist.
- `decisions[]`: `what`, `who`, `by` (date), `recommendation`. Every open question gets your recommendation, so the client confirms or overrides instead of starting from nothing.
- `references[]`: `name`, `layer` (`structure`, `presentation`, `photography`), `borrow`, `not`. Internal: never shown in the book.
- `changelog[]`: `version`, `date`, `change`.
